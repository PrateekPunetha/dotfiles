# I Prefer the episode name of the show in the video File, Because It is informative,
# looks simple, and is just clean to read.
# This script filters the Wikipedia source and outputs the episode names.
# With this list, I can just bulk rename the 'default' file names.
# Example: eplist 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba_(season_2)'
